Newsfeed User Engagement Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)

# Project Overview

This project analyzes user interaction patterns within a newsfeed platform. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights how users engage through visits, likes, comments, and manual post creation. The goal is to understand user behavior and identify key engagement trends.

# Problem Statement

Raw engagement data alone cannot explain how users interact with content. The challenge was to transform this data into meaningful insights by answering:

• How many users actively engage with the newsfeed?

• What engagement actions are most common?

• How do interactions vary over time?

• Which activities reflect deeper user involvement?

This project visualizes these metrics to support better decision-making.

# Key Fields Used:

Field	Meaning
visited_count:	Users who viewed the newsfeed
active_users_count:	Users who performed likes/comments/posts
liked_count:	Users who liked at least one post
commented_count:	Users who commented at least once
posted_count:	Users who created one or more posts

# Key Insights Identified

Newsfeed reach is high, but a smaller portion of users convert to active engagement.

Likes are the most common interaction type.

Comments and post creation happen less frequently, indicating deeper but less common engagement.

User activity patterns remain consistent, with occasional spikes driven by content trends.

These insights help understand platform engagement quality and audience involvement.
